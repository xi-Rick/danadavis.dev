Hey everyone, coming at you with some heavy thoughts today. As a Black man in America, I feel compelled to share my perspective on Donald Trump's Project 2025. Buckle up, because this is going to be a bumpy ride.


Read the full plan


The Plan: More Than Just Immigration


Now, I get it. Cracking down on illegal immigration is a complex issue. 


But Project 2025 goes way beyond that. We're talking about:

- Mass deportations
- Increased ICE raids
- Detention camps for migrants
- Banning entry from certain Muslim-majority countries
- Ending birthright citizenship
- Using the DOJ to go after political opponents
- Targeting journalists for prosecution


That's a lot to unpack, and none of it sits well with me.


The Rhetoric of Hate

What really gets me is the tone. It's not just about policy; it's about championing hatred while claiming moral high ground. As someone whose ancestors were brought here in chains, that kind of talk sets off all kinds of alarms.


History Repeating?

Here's where it gets real for me. I don't trust them to stop at just undocumented immigrants. Our country has a dark history of oppression, and some folks seem hellbent on either burying that history or, in places like Florida, trying to spin it as somehow beneficial.


As a Black man, let me be clear: I don't care if talking about this history makes you uncomfortable. It's my life, my reality that you get to ignore. And that hurts.


The Founding Fathers Paradox


It's wild to me how some people idolize the Founding Fathers while pushing for what amounts to a monarchy under Trump. Didn't those guys literally run away from a monarchy? Make it make sense.

And here's a thought that keeps me up at night: Why did they have to drag Black people into this mess in the first place? They could have done their whole revolution thing without enslaving us. Sometimes I wonder if they'd just stayed in Britain, would we be better off?


The Intentional Divide

At this point, it feels intentional. The constant attempts to bury or rewrite our history, the divisive rhetoric, the policies that disproportionately affect people of color ‚Äì it's hard not to see it as a calculated move to keep us down.


Where Do We Go From Here?


I don't have all the answers, but I know we can't stay silent. We need to:

1.  Call out harmful rhetoric and policies
2.  Educate ourselves and others about our true history
3.  Vote and encourage others to do the same
4.  Support organizations fighting for equality and justice
5.  Have those uncomfortable conversations with friends and family


Wrapping Up


Look, I know this is heavy stuff. But as a Black man in America, this is my reality. Project 2025 isn't just a policy proposal ‚Äì it's a threat to the progress we've fought so hard for.


What are your thoughts on this? How do you think we can push back against these harmful ideas? Drop your comments below, and let's keep this conversation going.


Stay woke, stay engaged, and above all, stay hopeful. We've overcome before, and we'll do it again.


Peace out, fam. ‚úäüèæ
