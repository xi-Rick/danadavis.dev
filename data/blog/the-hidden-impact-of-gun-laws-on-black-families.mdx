A Personal Perspective on Systemic Challenges


The Ongoing Struggle

As a Black man in America, I've been deeply troubled by the ongoing efforts to incarcerate Black men for various reasons. It's a reality that many choose to ignore, living in blissful ignorance of the systemic issues plaguing our communities. However, recent developments have shifted my focus to a new concern: the potential targeting of Black women through seemingly well-intentioned legislation.


Michigan's New Gun Law

In Michigan, a new gun law has caught my attention. This law holds parents responsible if a minor gains access to a firearm and it's discharged. While the intention behind this legislation may be noble, I can't help but see its potential to disproportionately affect Black families, particularly Black women.


The Disproportionate Impact

Why? In many Black households, the father is absent, leaving single mothers as the primary caregivers. This new law could potentially place these women at risk of incarceration if their child were to accidentally access a firearm. It's a sobering thought that highlights the often-overlooked consequences of broad legislative measures.


The Crumbley Case and Its Aftermath

The law came in the wake of the Crumbley case, where parents James and Jennifer Crumbley were sentenced to prison after their son, Ethan, carried out a school shooting. While holding parents accountable for their children's actions might seem reasonable on the surface, we must consider the broader implications for communities already struggling with systemic inequalities.


Raising Awareness

I've taken it upon myself to spread awareness about this law among my family members. It's crucial that we understand not just the letter of the law, but its potential impact on our community. While I agree with the concept of responsible gun ownership, I can't ignore who might be hurt most by its enforcement.


The Bigger Picture

This situation is just one example of the many attacks on Black families that I've observed. It's a reminder that we must remain vigilant, looking beyond the surface of new legislation to understand its true implications. As we continue to fight for equality and justice, we must also be aware of the subtle ways in which systemic racism can manifest in our legal system.


A Call to Action

I encourage everyone to stay informed, engage in discussions about these issues, and advocate for laws that protect all members of our community equally. Only through awareness and action can we hope to create a more just society for future generations.
