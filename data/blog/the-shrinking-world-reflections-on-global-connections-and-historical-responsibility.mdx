A Global Circle of Friends


As I sit here in my early 30s, I'm struck by the realization that many of my friends have never set foot in America. 


From Germany to India, Trinidad to London, my social circle spans the globe. It's a testament to how our world has changed, becoming increasingly interconnected with each passing generation.


The Generational Divide in Global Perspective

I recently had a conversation about the situation in Gaza that highlighted this generational shift. To my cousin, who's 20 years older, the conflict seemed distant and abstract. But for me, it feels much closer to home. Why? Because I've interacted with people from all over the world through online gaming and social media.


The Evolution of Global Connectivity

Think about it: when I was a kid, the idea of playing a video game with someone in India was pure science fiction. Now, as a 30-year-old, I've been doing exactly that for the past decade. And for the generation after mine, the world is even smaller still.


A Call for Change and Understanding


This shrinking world calls for a new approach to global citizenship and understanding. We need to make some kind of change to match our increasingly connected reality.


Learning from Germany: A Model of Historical Accountability

I have a specific challenge for my fellow white Americans: seek out a German friend, particularly one who has never lived in the United States. Why? Because Germany offers a powerful lesson in confronting and atoning for historical atrocities.


Reparations and Remembrance

Germany is one of the few nations to offer reparations for past wrongdoings, specifically for the Holocaust. They've erected monuments to Hitler's victims, ensuring that their citizens never forget the horrors of that era.


Facing History Head-On

Unlike many countries that attempt to whitewash their past, Germany has faced its history squarely. They've even gone so far as to change their national anthem â€“ a step that's hard to imagine in many other countries, including the United States.


The Challenge of Historical Accountability


This level of national self-reflection and atonement is something that, in my opinion, white Americans have struggled to achieve. It's why I believe we have so much to learn from the German example.


A Call to Action

So, I encourage you: reach out, make connections, and learn from those who have grappled with their nation's dark history. In our shrinking world, understanding and accountability are more important than ever.
