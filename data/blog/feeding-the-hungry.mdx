There are a few ways we can go about ending like world hunger even making more places on Earth more hospitable but it always requires like will you know like that's all that most accomplishments require you know the will of you know enough people to get something done and that's like what it takes to build a house to build you know anything you know bigger than that you know so like for instance like we go about trying to solve like world hunger world hunger is a tool you're hunger is a tool many lands have always used to you know as I could control mechanism over people you know and they use laws money whatever things they can as like a mechanism over life I don't know how fundamental it is but it's become an instinct that humans do I don't even I don't even want to call it an instinct because it would be like you know other other things that humans can contemplate you know they don't act on we need to start throwing more things into that category. For a thing like world hunger I keep thinking you know places like the ICC that you win or maybe even like another body that gets created down the line and what I'm thinking of isn't something that's going to happen in my lifetime or thing something that could possibly happen there may be too many forces that could stop such a thing but be there could be some type of system where you know that's like a goal that's going to happen and you know the mechanisms that exist within countries can be pulled to help go towards a cause like you know a whole country is you know barred from all World travel finance trade and whatever else unless you know like a million dollars or whatever some of money that you know someone comes up with that goes towards you know feeding or allowing you know the infrastructure to be built or you know whatever thing that needs to be made for people to have more agency in some place those are things that could happen and like I'm thinking those could be like you know emergency response things that the world needs to be able to respond to not out of some sense of altruism or even a sense of like nothing more than what's dutiful. The only reason these things stop happening or just agreed that a lot of people have you know greed is an ever-present thing so as long as you know as long as bear conditions can't be met I think greed will always exist you know I think that's actually like the solution for greed is to just meet whatever living standard the world or whatever society has created like every you know 10 years or something and then like I really think greed goes away you know people stop being in competition with each other they stop fighting and then they get to you know actually know that person instead of you know knowing the company they work for more.
