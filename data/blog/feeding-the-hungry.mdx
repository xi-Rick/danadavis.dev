There are a few ways we can go about ending world hunger and making more places on Earth more hospitable, but it always requires will. That's all that most accomplishments require—the will of enough people to get something done. That's what it takes to build a house, to build anything bigger than that.

## World Hunger as a Control Mechanism

World hunger is a tool. Hunger is a tool many lands have always used as a control mechanism over people. They use laws, money, whatever things they can as mechanisms over life. I don't know how fundamental it is, but it's become an instinct that humans do. I don't even want to call it an instinct because there are other things that humans can contemplate that they don't act on—we need to start throwing more things into that category.

## A New International Framework

For a thing like world hunger, I keep thinking about places like the ICC at the UN, or maybe even another body that gets created down the line. What I'm thinking of isn't something that's going to happen in my lifetime, or something that could possibly happen—there may be too many forces that could stop such a thing.

But there could be some type of system where ending world hunger is a goal that's going to happen, and the mechanisms that exist within countries can be pulled to help go towards this cause. A whole country could be barred from all world travel, finance, trade, and whatever else unless a million dollars—or whatever sum of money that someone comes up with—goes towards feeding people or allowing the infrastructure to be built or whatever thing that needs to be made for people to have more agency in some place.

## Emergency Response, Not Altruism

Those are things that could happen. I'm thinking these could be emergency response things that the world needs to be able to respond to—not out of some sense of altruism or even a sense of charity, but nothing more than what's dutiful.

## The Root Cause: Greed and Its Solution

The only reason these things stop happening is greed that a lot of people have. Greed is an ever-present thing, so as long as bare conditions can't be met, I think greed will always exist.

I think that's actually the solution for greed: just meet whatever living standard the world or whatever society has created, like every ten years or something. Then I really think greed goes away. People stop being in competition with each other, they stop fighting, and then they get to actually know that person instead of knowing the company they work for more.
