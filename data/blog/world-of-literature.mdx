The Power of Escape

From the moment I discovered the power of books, they became my ultimate escape. There's something magical about diving into a story, leaving behind the familiar world and immersing yourself in something entirely new. I'm sure many of you can relate to this feeling.


Early Reading Habits

Growing up, I devoured books indiscriminately. It didn't matter who wrote them or what genre they belonged to - I just picked them up and started reading. The joy was in the act itself, in discovering new words, learning how to use prefixes, and mastering different grammar structures. Each book was a stepping stone to expanding my linguistic abilities and imagination.

As a child, some of my favorite authors were the titans of young adult literature. JK Rowling's Harry Potter series was a cornerstone of my reading journey, despite the controversies surrounding her today. 


Owen Colfer and Rick Riordan also played significant roles in shaping my literary tastes.


Evolving Tastes

As I grew older, my reading preferences evolved. I discovered Sherrilyn Kenyon and fell in love with the intricate mythologies she wove into her stories. I also began to appreciate classics like Shakespeare's Hamlet, realizing the timeless nature of great literature.

It's fascinating to think about how stories have been passed down through generations. Before the written word, oral traditions kept tales alive. This connection to our past through storytelling is something I deeply appreciate.


Current Reading List

These days, my reading list is eclectic. I enjoy the thrilling narratives of James Patterson, the fantasy worlds of Cassandra Clare, and the suspenseful plots of Dean Koontz. I've also developed a passion for comics, particularly from DC, which offer a unique blend of visual and narrative storytelling.

Science fiction and fantasy continue to captivate me. Authors like Cindy Williams Chima, Michael Scott, and Morgan Rice have taken me on incredible journeys through their imaginative worlds. And who could forget Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code? It's a perfect example of how books can blend history, mystery, and adventure.


Reflecting on My Journey

As I reflect on my reading journey, I realize how much books have shaped me. They've broadened my horizons, improved my language skills, and provided countless hours of entertainment. While my current job involves a lot of documentation reading, I'm trying to reignite my passion for fiction.
