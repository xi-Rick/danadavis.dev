Before running a global prune, inspect what's unused and remove only what you expect.

```bash
# inspect usage
docker system df
docker image ls -f dangling=true

# prune safely
docker container prune -f
docker image prune -f
docker volume prune -f
```

Use `docker system prune` only when you know removing networks/volumes/images is safe for your environment.
