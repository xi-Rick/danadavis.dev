summary: "Example `~/.ssh/config` entries for using multiple keys and identities per host (work + personal)."
tags: ["ssh","dotfiles","git"]

Use named entries in `~/.ssh/config` to keep work and personal identities separate.

```text
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal
  IdentitiesOnly yes

Host github-work
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

Use `git@github-work:owner/repo.git` for your work remote and `git@github.com:owner/repo.git` for personal.
