Handy `jq` commands for everyday JSON inspection and transformation.

```bash
# pretty print
cat data.json | jq .

# extract array field
cat data.json | jq '.items | map(.name)'

# filter where active is true
cat data.json | jq '.items[] | select(.active == true)'

# compact log-friendly output
cat data.json | jq -c '.items[] | {id, name}'
```

`jq` is indispensable for quick ad-hoc parsing when building or debugging CLI-based data flows.
