Interactive rebase is your friend when you want to clean up history before opening or merging a PR.

```bash
# edit last 5 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~5

# editor commands inside rebase
# pick -> keep as-is
# reword -> change commit message
# edit -> pause and amend
# squash/fixup -> combine commits

# after amend
git add -A && git rebase --continue
```

Keep rebasing small and make a backup branch if you're unsure — interactive rebase rewrites history.
