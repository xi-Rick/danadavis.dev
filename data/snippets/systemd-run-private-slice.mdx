`systemd-run` is great for running a process in an isolated transient unit with runtime limits. Example:

```bash
sudo systemd-run --unit=temp-bench --slice=bench.slice --property=MemoryMax=512M --property=CPUQuota=50% --scope /usr/bin/time -v ./run-my-benchmark.sh
```

This runs `run-my-benchmark.sh` in `bench.slice` with memory and CPU caps so it's easy to repeat tests without creating persistent units.
